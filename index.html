  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I am a senior in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University, specializing in digital VLSI and computer architecture. 
    My current research focuses on hardware prefetching implementations to improve memory performance. 
    As part of this work, I use FireSim, a Vivado-based FPGA simulation framework, to implement, simulate, and evaluate prefetcher designs on RISC-V cores.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    I am seeking a digital design or verification internship for Summer 2026 to apply my skills in an industry environment and contribute to innovative projects.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Looking ahead, my goals are to complete a Masterâ€™s degree by May 2027. 
    Within this time I will continue to advance research on improving memory performance. 
    Beyond graduate study, I am eager to begin my career in computer architecture and VLSI design, 
    where I can expand my industry experience and contribute to innovative hardware solutions.

        <h4>HW-Prefetchers and FireSim Research</h4>
        <p>
          Currently researching hardware prefetchers, comparing timeliness, accuracy, and coverage of different prefetcher designs.
          The goal is to improve memory performance by reducing cache miss rates and memory access latency.
          This includes implementing and designing custom prefetchers for RISC-V cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main role includes synthesizing and evaluating prefetcher designs using FireSim, a Vivado-based FPGA-accelerated cycle-accurate simulator.
          This involves creating Chipyard and FireSim documentation for other researchers to use, including setup, configuration, and usage instructions.
          Additionally, I read and present research papers on prefetching techniques to my research group.
          Certain prefetcher designs are implemented in Chisel, a hardware construction language embedded in Scala, and their memory performance is analyzed.

      <div class="project-card">
        <h4>Digital ASIC Fabrication - Graphics Pipeline</h4>
        <p>
          Developing a programmable 3D graphics pipeline that uses a hardware rasterizer to display textured objects on a screen via VGA.
          The objective is to completely fabricate a digital ASIC, following the full ASIC design flow of 
          hardware architecture, RTL design, verification, synthesis, layout, and tapeout preparation.
          This project is in collaboration with ISU's Chipforge, utilizing its toolflow for Verilog design, simulation, and verification. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My role is toolflow lead. This involves getting new members acquainted with the Chipforge toolflow,
          assisting with Verilog design and verification. Additionally, I am implementing UVM (Universal Verification Methodology used for ASIC verification)
          into the Chipforge toolflow, which will benefit the functionality of our project and future Chipforge projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project will benefit future students by providing a documented ASIC design flow using open-source tools,
          and the GPU architecture can be built upon by future Chipforge members and programmed by embedded GPU enthusiasts.
          This project is still in progress, but more details and documentation on the project can be found on our website linked below.

        <h4>MIPS Pipeline Processor</h4>
        <p>
          Designed, verified, and analyzed three different MIPS processors: 
          Single-Cycle, 5-stage Software-Scheduled pipeline, and 5-stage Hardware-Scheduled pipeline.
          Final processor included full forwarding and hazard avoidance, to minimize CPI.
          Synthesized each processor to get timing information and compare performances.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main role was HDL design, using VHDL to implement different functional units.
          I also helped my partner with verification, writing testbenches in VHDL and simulating using ModelSim.
          Each top-level processor was verified using assembly programs, assembled with MARS simulator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the project was to apply understanding of processor microarchitecture and design.
          Furthermore, the deliverable included timing analysis and performance comparison of each processor.
          Another takeaway was more involved digital design skills, primarily VHDL and assembly programming.
          The link below contains my code and documentation for the project.

        <h4>Backend App Developer</h4>
        <p>
          I designed and implemented a Spring Bootâ€“based backend to support a full-stack application. The backend served as the foundation for business logic, database management, and third-party service integration. It provided a reliable and scalable API layer to enable smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary role was to architect the backend, build RESTful CRUDL endpoints, and model relational data in MySQL using one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. I also integrated external APIs to handle exercise data and payment processing, ensuring that the application could deliver real-world functionality to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this project, I strengthened my skills in Spring Boot, REST API design, relational database modeling, and query optimization. I also gained practical experience with external API integration, error handling, and endpoint security. Working closely with the frontend team improved my collaboration and testing practices.
        </p>
          To complete the project, I relied on several resources, including Spring Boot and MySQL documentation, Postman for testing, and API references from third-party providers. I also used online tutorials, forums, and GitHub examples to troubleshoot challenges and refine the implementation.

        <h4>Autonomous Embedded Robot</h4>
        <p>
          I programmed an iRobot Create 2 to autonomously navigate a warehouse-like environment. The robot was designed to detect and avoid obstacles such as walls, columns, and spills, enabling it to operate safely and effectively in a dynamic space. A custom Python-based GUI was developed to control the robot and display real-time status updates, creating a user-friendly interface for monitoring its performance.</p>
          <p>My role in the project was to implement the autonomous navigation logic, integrate Ping and IR sensors for obstacle detection, and establish UART communication between the robot and the Python GUI. I was responsible for ensuring smooth interaction between hardware and software components while optimizing the robotâ€™s decision-making for safe navigation.</p>
          <p>Through this work, I gained valuable experience in robotics programming, sensor integration, and real-time system design. I also developed skills in serial communication, GUI development with Python, and practical debugging of hardware-software interactions. This project reinforced my problem-solving abilities in handling unpredictable environments and edge cases.</p>
          <p>The project relied on resources such as the iRobot Create 2 Open Interface (OI) documentation, datasheets for Ping and IR sensors, Python libraries for GUI and UART communication, and online robotics tutorials and forums. These materials guided the implementation and troubleshooting process, ensuring a robust and reliable system.
